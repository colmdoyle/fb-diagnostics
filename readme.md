# FB Diagnostics

For the sake of debugging a problem, sometimes it's useful to have an app that has an "at a glance" output of various different Facebook features / endpoints. This is just such a tool.

It doesn't attempt to skin itself as a full app. It's just a dashboard of information and one click access to various [Facebook Dialogs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/) and other publishing endpoints, like [OG Actions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/opengraph/actions/) and [/feed](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/#feed)

## Examples 

You can see it running as a Page Tab [here](https://www.facebook.com/DiagnosticsApp/app_120999667956026)

You can see it running as a Canvas App [here](https://apps.facebook.com/diagnostics-app)
